# Login Form App - Mobile Programming Assignment

A modern login form application developed as part of a Mobile Programming course assignment using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.

## Features

- **Clean UI Design**: Simple and modern interface built with Material 3 components
- **Form Validation**: Complete validation for all input fields
- **User Feedback**: Toast messages for successful registration or validation errors
- **Password Security**: Toggle visibility for password fields and password confirmation

## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin**: Primary programming language
- **Jetpack Compose**: UI toolkit for native Android UI
- **Material 3**: Design system for modern Android UI components
- **Gradle KTS**: Kotlin-based build configuration

## Why Jetpack Compose?

I chose Jetpack Compose for this project for several key reasons:

1. **Modern Development Approach**: Compose represents Android's recommended modern toolkit for UI development, making it an important skill to develop as a student.

2. **Declarative UI Pattern**: Compose's declarative approach simplifies UI development by focusing on describing what the UI should look like at any state, rather than the traditional imperative approach of XML layouts.

3. **Reduced Boilerplate Code**: Compared to traditional XML layouts and view binding, Compose requires significantly less code to achieve the same or better results.

4. **State Management**: Built-in state management tools make handling UI state much more straightforward and less error-prone than traditional approaches.

5. **Preview Feature**: The @Preview annotation allows for instant UI previews without running the app, speeding up the development process.

6. **Animation Support**: While not heavily used in this project, Compose has powerful built-in animation capabilities that make complex animations much easier to implement.

7. **Future-Proof Skills**: As Google pushes Compose as the future of Android UI development, learning it now provides valuable skills for future employability.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the project in Android Studio Hedgehog or later
3. Build and run on an emulator or physical device with API level 24 or higher

## Future Improvements

- Add database integration for user registration
- Implement a login screen for returning users
- Add more animations for smoother user experience
- Integrate with a backend API for authentication
